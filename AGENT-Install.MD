# Protect the Docker daemon socket
By default, Docker runs through a non-networked UNIX socket. It can also optionally communicate using an HTTP socket.

# TLS Auth Docker
## Prerequisites:

```
HOST=<MY_FULL_FQDN>
```

## Prepare and create your Own CA
Using TLS and managing a CA is an advanced topic. Please familiarize yourself with OpenSSL, x509, and TLS before using it in production.

Create a CA, server and client keys with OpenSSL

Note: Replace all instances of $HOST in the following example with the DNS name of your Docker daemon’s host.

First, on the Docker daemon’s host machine, generate CA private and public keys:
```
$ openssl genrsa -aes256 -out ca-key.pem 4096
Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus
............................................................................................................................................................................................++
........++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
Enter pass phrase for ca-key.pem:
Verifying - Enter pass phrase for ca-key.pem:
```

```
$ openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -key ca-key.pem -sha256 -out ca.pem
Enter pass phrase for ca-key.pem:
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [XX]:US
State or Province Name (full name) []:California
Locality Name (eg, city) [Default City]:Pasadena
Organization Name (eg, company) [Default Company Ltd]:Caltech
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:HEP
Common Name (eg, your name or your server's hostname) []: $HOST
Email Address []: <MY_EMAIL_ADDRESS>
```
Now that you have a CA, you can create a server key and certificate signing request (CSR). Make sure that “Common Name” matches the hostname you use to connect to Docker:

Note: Replace all instances of $HOST in the following example with the DNS name of your Docker daemon’s host.
```
$ openssl genrsa -out server-key.pem 4096
Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus (2 primes)
...............................++++
........................................++++
e is 65537 (0x010001)
```

```
$ openssl req -subj "/CN=$HOST" -sha256 -new -key server-key.pem -out server.csr
```
Next, we’re going to sign the public key with our CA:

Since TLS connections can be made through IP address as well as DNS name, the IP addresses need to be specified when creating the certificate. For example, to allow connections using 10.10.10.20 and 127.0.0.1:

```
$ echo subjectAltName = DNS:$HOST,IP:10.10.10.20,IP:127.0.0.1 >> extfile.cnf
```
Set the Docker daemon key’s extended usage attributes to be used only for server authentication:
```
$ echo extendedKeyUsage = serverAuth >> extfile.cnf
```
Now, generate the signed certificate:
```
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -sha256 -in server.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem \
  -CAcreateserial -out server-cert.pem -extfile extfile.cnf
Signature ok
subject=/CN=your.host.com
Getting CA Private Key
Enter pass phrase for ca-key.pem:
```
Authorization plugins offer more fine-grained control to supplement authentication from mutual TLS. In addition to other information described in the above document, authorization plugins running on a Docker daemon receive the certificate information for connecting Docker clients.

# Client Certificate/Key

For client authentication, create a client key and certificate signing request:

Note: For simplicity of the next couple of steps, you may perform this step on the Docker daemon’s host machine as well.
```
$ openssl genrsa -out key.pem 4096
Generating RSA private key, 4096 bit long modulus
.........................................................++
................++
e is 65537 (0x10001)
```
```
$ openssl req -subj '/CN=$HOST-client' -new -key key.pem -out client.csr
```
To make the key suitable for client authentication, create a new extensions config file:
```
$ echo extendedKeyUsage = clientAuth > extfile-client.cnf
```
Now, generate the signed certificate:
```
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -sha256 -in client.csr -CA ca.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem \
  -CAcreateserial -out cert.pem -extfile extfile-client.cnf
Signature ok
subject=/CN=client
Getting CA Private Key
Enter pass phrase for ca-key.pem:
```
After generating cert.pem and server-cert.pem you can safely remove the two certificate signing requests and extensions config files:
```
$ rm -v client.csr server.csr extfile.cnf extfile-client.cnf
```
With a default umask of 022, your secret keys are world-readable and writable for you and your group.

To protect your keys from accidental damage, remove their write permissions. To make them only readable by you, change file modes as follows:
```
$ chmod -v 0400 ca-key.pem key.pem server-key.pem
```
Certificates can be world-readable, but you might want to remove write access to prevent accidental damage:
```
$ chmod -v 0444 ca.pem server-cert.pem cert.pem
```
Now you can make the Docker daemon only accept connections from clients providing a certificate trusted by your CA:

```
$ mkdir /var/lib/docker/certs/
$ cp -v {ca,server-cert,server-key}.pem  /var/lib/docker/certs/
$ vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --tlsverify --tlscacert=/var/lib/docker/certs/ca.pem --tlscert=/var/lib/docker/certs/server-cert.pem --tlskey=/var/lib/docker/certs/server-key.pem -H=0.0.0.0:2376 -H=fd:// --containerd=/run/containerd/containerd.sock
```
NOTE: Make sure you copy all other dockerd startup parameters you had, like `--data-root /Data/docker/` and etc.

After editing systemd service - make sure to reload systemctl daemon and restart docker service:
```
systemctl daemon-reload
service docker restart
```

To connect to Docker and validate its certificate, provide your client keys, certificates and trusted CA:

Run it on the client machine

This step should be run on your Docker client machine. As such, you need to copy your CA certificate, your server certificate, and your client certificate to that machine.
Note: Replace all instances of $HOST in the following example with the DNS name of your Docker daemon’s host.
```
$ docker --tlsverify --tlscacert=ca.pem --tlscert=cert.pem --tlskey=key.pem \
  -H=$HOST:2376 version
```
Note: Docker over TLS should run on TCP port 2376.

Warning: As shown in the example above, you don’t need to run the docker client with sudo or the docker group when you use certificate authentication.

That means anyone with the keys can give any instructions to your Docker daemon, giving them root access to the machine hosting the daemon. Guard these keys as you would a root password!

# Secure by default
If you want to secure your Docker client connections by default, you can move the files to the .docker directory in your home directory --- and set the DOCKER_HOST and DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY variables as well (instead of passing -H=tcp://$HOST:2376 and --tlsverify on every call).
```
$ mkdir -pv ~/.docker
$ cp -v {ca,cert,key}.pem ~/.docker
```
```
$ export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://$HOST:2376 DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1
```
Docker now connects securely by default:
```
$ docker ps
```

# Portainer mode:
You will need to send a copy of your CA certificate, and your client certificate and key (or issue a new client certificate/key) to that Portainer instance administrator.


# Firewall

Please contact SENSE team to find out an IP where portainer is running and open port 2376 (or another if you used different one for setting up docker) and execute the following commands:

X.X.X.X/XX - Replace with an IP/Netmask received from SENSE Team
PPPP - Replace to port docker daemon listens.

```
$ firewall-cmd --new-zone=senseportainer --permanent
success
$ firewall-cmd --reload
success
$ firewall-cmd --zone=senseportainer --add-source=X.X.X.X/XX --permanent
success
$ firewall-cmd --zone=senseportainer --add-port=PPPP/tcp --permanent
success
```
